Hi Mr. D,

Some notes about my project:

1) It only renders correctly in Safari, so please use that to view the project.
This means that the other browsers are simply not cool enough to handle my project

2) Things you can do:
	* Zoom in and out using the mouse wheel
	* Click on the buttons to toggle info/maps
	* Click on the boxes for information
	* Learn about the sky
	
3) Intention:
	Write a accurate 360 degree map of the night sky with interactive features. The constellations are in mostly the right places.
	
Thank you.
